HOW TO USE NONLOCAL OPERATOR IN WRFDA (namelist.input) (Shu-Ya Chen)
1. add USE_GPSEPHOBS =  T in &wrfvar4 for GPS RO data in atmPrf
2. add USE_GPSREFOBS =  T in &wrfvar4 and use_nonlocal = T in &wrfvar5 for GPS RO data in bfrPrf
3. provide an observation error (OBSERROR.TBL) for the nonlocal operator
4. The nonlocal operator in this version only works for serial run

History for implement of nonlocal operator in WRFDA v3.2

1. The nonlocal operator is implemented into WRFDA v3.2 in Feb. 2011 (v201102). (Shu-Ya Chen and Shu-Hua Chen)
But an inconsistency in the tangent linear and adjoint check in the version of 201102.

2. Fix bugs and pass through successfully for the tangent linear and adjoint checking in Mar. 2012 (v201203). (Shu-Ya Chen)

3. Shu-Ya Chen found that a conversion problem in geometric and geopotential height: 
It is no problem for WRFDA V2, because it uses geometric heigh for both model and observation. There is a conversion in the operator to convert the model geopotential height into geometric height.
In current version (V3), the observed geometric height has been converted into geopotential height after reading the observation. But the conversion for model height(geopotential-->geometric) is still keeping in the subroutine, it will make an inconsistent information for assimilation. 
The conversion of modle height in nonlocal operator (geopotential --> geometric) had been removed and use the xb%h (original modeled geopotential height) as the geo_h for the calculation of model mean height in Jun. 2012 (v201206). (Shu-Ya Chen)

4. Shu-Ya Chen migrate the nonlocal operator into WRFDA v3.3.1 (version: CWB OP24) 

5. The GPS data for nonlocal operator used to be atmPrf. This version (v3.3.1) had been modified to read either atmPrf or bfrPrf for the nonlocal operator. (Shu-Ya Chen, Sept. 2012)

KEYWORDS: ARW diffusion cleanup

SOURCE: internal

PURPOSE: Remove unnecessary "mu" arguments, remove "I was here" comments.  Prepare 
code for hybrid coordinate port.

DESCRIPTION OF CHANGES: 
With the conservation modifications introduced for ARW diffusion (from Stefan
Tulich), there are quite a few places where the "mu" field is no longer required.
In anticipation of the hybrid vertical coordinate introduction, those are all
being removed.  All of the horizontal and vertical diffusion calls now use
density (rho).  The only routines in the module that still use "mu" are 
tke_rhs, tke_shear, tke_buoyancy, tke_dissap.  The calls to the diffusion 
routines from first_rk_step_part2 are modified to remove "mu".  For the routines
in module_diffusion_em.F that use "mu", the declarations and other averaging
computations are removed.

A few "I was here" comments are removed:
!SNT
!JDM
!new code
!new
... and some comments from a Rich Rotunno reference.

I removed all of the original code that Stefan Tulich's mods replaced (they
were commented out, and should be removed).

Finally, I removed all of the trailing blanks.
 
LIST OF MODIFIED FILES (annotated if not obvious, not required to be on a single line): 
M       dyn_em/module_diffusion_em.F  (lots of lines of changes)
M       dyn_em/module_first_rk_step_part2.F  (one line each in h and v diffusion calls)

TESTS CONDUCTED:
1) A regression test is about to be started.

2) I have done some simple bit-for-bit tests, and I get the same results (before vs 
after my mods).  I did a fully optimized 24-h Jan 2000 case, and a fully optimized
hill2d_x case.  I'll do a more rigorous test with the regression results.

==============

I did quite a bit of source code diffing to make the diffs as clean as possible.  If 
you are interested in looking, do an xxdiff of the two files:
xxdiff ${OLD_DIR}/module_diffusion_em.F ${NEW_DIR}/module_diffusion_em.F
THEN under "Options" for xxdiff, turn on all of the "Ignore" settings: trailing blanks,
whitespace, case, blank lines.  This will take the code diffs from 332 places down to a
manageable 138.  However, this still picks up all of the "!JDM" and "!SNT" changes.  

To zap those comment differences, run the xxdiff on the manufactured .f90 files.  Then 
there are only 67 places with diffs (about 10 of those are from the automatic line 
numbers from the wrf_error_fatal calls).  The important diffs can be reviewed pretty 
quickly from the two module_diffusion_em.f90 files.

set OLD_DIR = /glade/scratch/gill/MU/TOP_OF_REPO/MU/WRFV3_9506_pristine/dyn_em
set NEW_DIR = /glade/scratch/gill/MU/TOP_OF_REPO/MU/WRFV3_9506_diffusion/dyn_em

I cleaned up these directories for my diffing.  After I tar up the files for a 
regression test, I'll rebuild these WRF directories.  They will be available 
after 7 PM on Weds.

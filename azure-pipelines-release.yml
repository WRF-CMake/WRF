# First, create a tag for the new version.
# Then, run this pipeline on the tag to store binaries in a draft GitHub release.

# Note that these values are also overridden to "none" in Azure DevOps's UI to
# prevent others to run this pipeline by changing the triggers below and opening a PR.
# It still wouldn't cause harm as secrets (GitHub credentials) are not available to PRs from forks.
